## **Selected Projects**

### [Supply chain network design and planning](https://github.com/Adlan-Boithier/Supply-Chain-La-Poste/)
  - Developed a solution in collaboration with the La Poste group to optimize the parcel delivery system in Paris using the **R programming language.** Processed over **70,000 delivery data points per month**, applying **vehicle routing problem (VRP)** algorithms and leveraging R's optimization libraries to design routes that **reduced delivery costs to around 1'000'000â‚¬ daily.** Proposed the use of the Paris metro system for parcel distribution as a sustainable and innovative solution, aligned with recent infrastructure improvements for enhanced efficiency.

### [Sustainable Logistics](https://github.com/Adlan-Boithier/Sustainable-Logistics/)
- Developed Python algorithms, including the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** and a **customized knapsack variant**, to optimize Swiss tourism. Created **7 scenarios** aimed at enhancing affordability, environmental sustainability, and travel efficiency. Conducted a **sensitivity analysis** to assess how changes in parameters like available budget impact the optimal route and the number of destinations visited, confirming key insights like the benefits of using a Half-Fare Card for larger budgets. This project addressed the challenge of high living costs in Switzerland by providing optimized, cost-effective, and eco-friendly travel plans, making the country more accessible to tourists.

### [Predictive Analytics for Premier League Team Performance](https://github.com/Adlan-Boithier/Premier-League-Prediction/)
- As an avid football fan, especially of the English Premier League, I developed a **predictive analytics model** for Premier League team performance using a **random forest algorithm.** The project involved cleaning and preparing data with **pandas**, followed by making match outcome predictions with **scikit-learn.** Enhanced model accuracy by implementing a **rolling averages method**, resulting in a **15% increase in precision.** Evaluated prediction errors and made iterative improvements, ultimately achieving an **additional 5% precision gain** in scenarios where a team was forecasted to win while the opponent was predicted to draw or lose.

### [Travel Preferences: Mountains vs Beaches](https://github.com/Adlan-Boithier/Mountains-vs-Beaches) 
- There is this old debate on how to spend a holiday : Go to the beach or climb in the mountains ? That that led me to asked myself if we could predict our preference based on our lifestyle and demographics ? This project allow **to visualize the distribution of preferences** and other key features, **examine correlations**, and **build a predictive model using a Random Forest Classifier.** The model achieved a **reasonable accuracy**, suggesting that demographic and lifestyle factors can indeed provide insights into travel preferences.
