### Education
Master of Science in Business Analytics
HEC Lausanne, University of Lausanne • Lausanne, Switzerland • 2024
• Selective program focused on providing students with advanced statistical and computational skills in order to tackle most of quantitative challenges in data. I acquired experience in data
understanding, cleaning and visualization, in both R and Python, choosing elective courses on data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques.

### Work Experience
Project Manager

Rolex S.A, February 2024 - July 2024, Geneva, Switzerland

• Led a project to create dashboards and metrics using Tableau, Tableau Prep, SQL and Excel aimed at analyzing the causes of incomplete supplier information. This information resulted in the establishment of new guidelines, leading to a 30% decrease in refusals over a five-month period.
• Spearheaded a project aimed at highlighting inconsistencies between contract details and the actual information present in contracts; Utilized Tableau to highlight that approximately 12% of contracts contained anomalies, amounting to hundreds of inconsistencies. 
• Implemented a business process enhancement initiative by applying operational excellence (OPEX) and design thinking principles, leading to streamlined workloads and enhanced work quality.
• Optimized an existing process in VBA within Excel to generate a list of outstanding payments for each buyer. This enhancement reduced the macro's execution time from several hours to under 5 minutes, significantly improving efficiency and freeing up time for other tasks.

### Projects
Taxi Fare Prediction in Chicago
• Trained a linear regression model using a real-world dataset containing thousands of taxi trips to predict taxi fare prices in Chicago, Illinois.
• Developed skills in reading and analyzing .csv files using pandas and creating visualizations with Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
• Experimented with 5+ features to optimize the model's performance, adjusting hyperparameters for improved accuracy.
• Evaluated model performance through Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), achieving a reduction of error by 15% after tuning.

Binary Classification of Turkish Rice Species
• Examined a dataset containing over 1,000 measurements derived from images of two Turkish rice species, Osmancik and Cammeo.
• Developed a binary classifier to accurately sort rice grains into the two species, achieving an accuracy rate of over 90%.
• Evaluated the model's performance using various metrics, including AUC (Area Under the Curve) and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis, comparing the effectiveness of two different models.
