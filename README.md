# Aspiring Data Analyst / Data Scientist

### **Education**
#### Master of Science in Business Analytics
#### HEC Lausanne, University of Lausanne • Lausanne, Switzerland • 2024
- Selective program focused on providing students with **advanced statistical and computational skills** in order to tackle most of quantitative challenges in data. I acquired experience in data
understanding, cleaning and visualization, in both **R and Python**, choosing elective courses on **data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques.**
- Projects : Time series analysis, Sentiment analysis, Web scrapping, Traveling Salesman Problem optimization, Data manipulation and visualization.

### **Work Experience**
#### Project Manager

#### Rolex S.A, February 2024 - July 2024, Geneva, Switzerland

- Led a project to create **dashboards and KPI's** using **Tableau, Tableau Prep, SQL and Excel** aimed at analyzing the causes of incomplete supplier information. This information resulted in the establishment of new guidelines, leading to a **30% decrease** in refusals over a five-month period.
- Spearheaded a project aimed at highlighting inconsistencies between contract details and the actual information present in contracts; Utilized **Tableau** to highlight that approximately **12%** of contracts contained anomalies, amounting to **hundreds of inconsistencies.** 
- Implemented a business process enhancement initiative by applying **operational excellence (OPEX)** and **design thinking principles**, leading to streamlined workloads and enhanced work quality.
- Optimized an existing process in **VBA** within **Excel** to generate a list of outstanding payments for each buyer. This enhancement reduced the macro's execution time from **several hours to under 5 minutes**, significantly improving efficiency and freeing up time for other tasks.

### **Projects**
#### Taxi Fare Prediction in Chicago
- Trained a **linear regression model** using a real-world dataset containing **thousands of taxi trips** to predict taxi fare prices in Chicago, Illinois.
- Developed skills in reading and analyzing **.csv files** using pandas and creating visualizations with Python libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn.**
- Experimented with **5+** features to optimize the model's performance, adjusting hyperparameters for improved accuracy.
- Evaluated model performance through **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, achieving a **reduction of error by 15%** after tuning.

#### Binary Classification of Turkish Rice Species
- Examined a dataset containing **over 1,000 measurements** derived from images of two Turkish rice species, Osmancik and Cammeo.
- Developed a **binary classifier** to accurately sort rice grains into the two species, achieving an **accuracy rate of over 90%.**
- Evaluated the model's performance using various metrics, including **AUC (Area Under the Curve)** and **ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic)** analysis, comparing the effectiveness of two different models.

### **Coursework**
#### Collaborations with companies in Data Science
- Conducted an in-depth analysis at Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève (HUG) on the factors influencing the scheduling and prioritization of specific vacations. This involved using **Excel** for **data preprocessing** and **R** for **exploratory data analysis and text mining.** The results showed **hundreds of errors** in patientsʼ data and laid the foundation for a complete overhaul of the data collection system, ultimately enhancing patient care.

#### Sustainable Logistics
- Used **Python** to optimize Swiss tourism through algorithms like **the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** and a **custom knapsack variant**, improving travel routes based on distance, time, and cost. Analysis highlighted underuse of the Swiss rail system, suggesting pricing adjustments for better tourist appeal.

#### Optimization Methods in Management Science
- Collaborated with the BioSuisse group to analyze price trends of over **60 vegetables** across **4 years**, comparing organic and non-organic varieties. Developed a clean, comprehensive datasource in **Excel** to compile price data, and leveraged **R**’s processing and visualization capabilities to create an **interactive dashboard**. This dashboard allowed users to track price evolution and select specific vegetables for detailed analysis.

#### Supply chain network design and planning
- Developed a solution in collaboration with the La Poste group to optimize the parcel delivery system in Paris using the **R programming language.** Processed over **70,000 delivery data points per month**, applying **vehicle routing problem (VRP)** algorithms and leveraging R's optimization libraries to design routes that **reduced delivery time by 35%** and **fuel consumption by 60%.** The solution aligns with ongoing initiatives at La Poste for improving logistical efficiency.

### **Involment**
#### Head of Communications

#### EPFL • Supernova • September 2019 - June 2021

- **Co-founded** the association, managed social media, promoted and organized environmental events and local artist showcases.
- Played a key role in creating and promoting an event that gathered over **400 attendees.**
- Organized online concerts on Twitch with over **100 participants** on each stream.

### **Skills**
